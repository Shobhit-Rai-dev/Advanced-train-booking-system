# Advanced Railway Ticket Booking System (C)

A comprehensive **C-based console application** that simulates an **IRCTC-like train reservation system** with:
- Admin control  
- Passenger management  
- File handling  
- Waitlist system  
- Meal options  
- E-wallet features  

This project demonstrates **structured programming, file handling, arrays, structures, and modular design in C**,  
making it ideal for **academic submission or GitHub portfolio display**.
